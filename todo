The disadvantages to using interrupt priorities are many:

More interrupt setup code
More complex ISR declaration
Higher latency for high-priority interrupts due to the necessary springboard GOTO
Much higher latency for low-priority interrupts since they can't use the fast register stack
Increased code space usage due to all of the above.
More hardware and software stack space is required.
