The disadvantages to using interrupt priorities are many:

More interrupt setup code
More complex ISR declaration
Higher latency for high-priority interrupts due to the necessary springboard GOTO
Much higher latency for low-priority interrupts since they can't use the fast register stack
Increased code space usage due to all of the above.
More hardware and software stack space is required.

Readout by the use of IEC1107 is in mode A.
Communication with the meter uses serial communication according to the RS232 standard. Setup for serial communication is 300 baud, 1 start bit, 7 data bits, even parity and 1 stop bit.
